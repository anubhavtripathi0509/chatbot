1) Theory + NLP concepts (stemming, tokenization, bag of words)
2) Create training data
3) PyTorch model and training
4) Save/Load model and implement the chat


NLP Basics

tokenization: splitting a string into meaningful units 
eg: "how are you?"
ans: ["how","are","you","?"]

stemming: Generate the root from of the words.
eg: "organize", "organizes", "organizing"
ans: ["organ","organ","organ"]
